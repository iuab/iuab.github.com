### [https://bit.ly/i-uab](https://bit.ly/i-uab)
Informatics WebApp ecosystem at the Univ Alabama at Birmingham. It uses the [wApps ecosystem](https://github.com/wApps/manifest#wapps-all-you-need-is-a-manifest) developed at the [Div Informatics](http://uab.mathbiol.org/informatics) of the Dept Pathology of UAB. A wApp is a ***"webApp in a hurry to be integrated in a web application ecosystem"***. As explained in that [documentation](https://github.com/wApps/manifest#wapps-all-you-need-is-a-manifest), the iUAB ecosystem relies on a single manifest file, maintained in this repository. If you are at UAB and want to submit your own wApp to this ecosystem please use the pull request mechanism, for the sake of full traceability.
